Key Activities
Notes
Project Charter
Draft Project Charter, review with key stakeholders and seek final approval before continuing with the project.
Define a number of key project elements including a project description, scope definition, and roles/responsibilities.  The documentation and review of these key project elements at the beginning of the project helps to avoid misunderstandings or confusion later on.
Complexity Matrix
Review project sizing criteria
Determine the level and type of project management most appropriate for your project.
Resource Allocation Matrix
Determine Resource Requirements
Estimate required resources by role and skill set. Discuss with the manager from each area involved to identify resource availability and gaps.
Business Case
Prepare Business Case
Provide detailed explanation of the scope, cost, and definition of the project. This information is normally required when it is necessary to provide an explanation of the benefits that will be realized as a result of the project. Larger or more complex projects usually require a Business Case.
Request for Information
Conduct Vendor Research
Conduct vendor research to see what technology is currently available in the market place. Contact the procurement office to identify vendors or to prepare a Request for Information (RFI). Consult with peers at other universities to determine potential solutions and their costs, benefits, and risks.
